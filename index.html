            <p>I've worked as a profesional photographer for about 5 years before starting to code. Before I would do small tutorials, but never really got passed printing "Hello World".
            One day I just downloaded an app for python on my Ipad, and suddenly fell in-love with coding. I would code every chance I had, and somewhere alog the line realized that I actually 
        want to persue a career in Web Development. I'm enrolled and Lambda School, and loving every minute of it! This has an amazing experience so far, and I'm looking foward for what is to come in the future! </p>
